/**
 * Pitch formations, from five a side to eight.
 *
 * A pachanga is whatever size turned up, so the squad size is a property of the
 * match (`matches.players_per_team`) and seven is only the most common case.
 *
 * The goalkeeper is not part of a formation name — they are always slot 0,
 * always at the bottom of their own half — so the name describes the outfield
 * lines alone and its own arithmetic gives the squad size: `2-3-1` is six
 * outfielders plus a keeper, so seven a side, while `2-2` is five. No two shapes
 * across the four sizes share a name, which is what lets one flat table below
 * serve all of them and `squadSizeOf` recover the size from the name.
 *
 * Migration 015 derives the same number the same way in SQL, and keeps every
 * match's formations consistent with its size.
 *
 * Coordinates are percentages of the pitch image, measured from its top-left.
 * Each team's pitch is drawn with their own goal at the bottom, so a larger `y`
 * is further back.
